                Vindinium is a game where each player writes code for an AI
                (artificial intelegence). The AI are then put to the test in
                competition against eachother. In order for the AI to know what
                to do, the player must write code to tell it how to react to its
                surroundings, which are constantly changing as the game 
                progresses. This is similar to the way that the computer players
                in digital versions of games such as chess or Hearts know how to
                move in response to the players movements when it is their turn.
                In vindinium, you win by having the most gold by the end of 1200
                turns. You obtain gold by taking control of mines, which are
                shown on the map. Each turn that passes, you gain one gold for
                each mine you own. However, the AIs can also attack eachother,
                and if you are killed, all of your mines become controled by
                whoever killed you. You won't die from just one hit, so in order
                to regain health, you must visit a tavern, which is represented
                by a large mug, to regain health.</p>
